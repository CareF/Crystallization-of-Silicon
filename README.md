# Crystallization of Silicon

This repository contains input files for simulating the crystallization of silicon using enhanced sampling methods.
Silicon is described using the Stillinger-Weber potential [Stillinger and Weber,  Phys. Rev. B, v. 31, p. 5262, (1985)](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.31.5262)
